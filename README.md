# ADT_Backend

Backend implementation of ABAP Development Tools (ADT) REST endpoints. These endpoints are requiered to connect the [abapGit repositories plugin](https://eclipse.abapgit.org/updatesite/) to the abapgit backend.

SAP has also published it's [official sources](https://github.com/SAP/project-odense) as they are provided in the SAP Cloud Platform ABAP Environment product.

**Highly Experimental**

### Requirements

1. [abapGit](https://github.com/larshp/abapGit) version with source code installed (report only won't work)
2. NW release â‰¥ 750

To fulfill requirement no. 1 you have to import [this repository](https://github.com/abapGit/abapGit/) via abapGit into your SAP system and activate the imported objects. A step by step instruction can be found [here](https://docs.abapgit.org/guide-online-install.html). Installation and execution of the abapGit report (non-developer version of abapGit) won't be sufficient.
